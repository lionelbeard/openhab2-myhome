# openhab2-myhome

These are openHAB configuration files I use for my home automation system.

I control my heat/cooling system (Hitachi + Airzone), my pool, my VMC/CMV and some Zwave stuffs.

Protocols used are:

Modbus serial (Airzone)
RFXCOM 433Mhz (Oregon probes)
ZWave (Smoke detectors & door detection)
One-wire (pool temperature probes)

This repo is only compatible with Openhab2 (after sucessfull migration from OH1!).
